# Adapter Pattern Examples

### Objective
Understand how the Adapter pattern works using examples in C#.

### Instructions
Feel free to look through the code to see how the Adapter Pattern can be implemented in a simple scenario, or revise the code and implement your own solution. The Domain classes are all sealed, which allows solutions utilizing composition and delegation, but also prevents any solutions from implementing inheritence. 

### Disclaimer
My code was adapted (...) from the example found on Wikipedia at the time of this writing, which I've included in a folder not ambiguously named. See the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern
